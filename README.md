## Project Overview 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
Welcome to our mysterious project! Honestly, we're still figuring out what it is ourselves. But we do know it's going to be **awesome**.

## How to Run the Project 🏃‍♂️💨
1. **Open the Project**: Fire up Unity and hope for the best! 🎲
2. **Check Dependencies**: If something's missing, blame the gremlins! 👾
3. **Run the Project**: Press play and watch the magic happen (or not) 🎩✨.

*Note: For those brave enough to dive deeper, check out the "Contributing" section... once we figure out what that means!*
